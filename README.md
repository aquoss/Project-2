# findMe

* Project Description

The app that we are developing is a mobile-friendly designed game that allows
users to play a version of hide and seek with their friends.  The idea of the
game is to have a hider send their location to the app, which will give the seeker
a map radius through Google Maps. There is also a wager option to make the game more interesting.
The seeker wins when they find the hiders location within 100 feet. The hider wins when the
seeker has run out of time and has not found the hider.

* User Stories

This game appeals to a user that is young and active throughout their city. A user
might be meeting a group of friends at a bar or restaurant, but wants to have a little
bit of fun while waiting. So by using this app, the user can invite friends, make wagers,
and track their friends progress in getting to their location.  Similarly, whomever is
invited can win a quick beer or appetizer by finding the hider before time runs out. This
app gives the user, whether hider or seeker, a fun way to meet up with friends.

* Wish List / Future Development

One thing we wish we could have added to this project is a "hint" button. We
wanted to incorporate a way for the seeker to have an easier way of finding the
hider. Hints would flash the location of the hider for part of a second, to give
the seeker a quick glimpse of where the hider is.
The future development of this project would also include a method of following
friends and giving the user a way to accrue followers and a list of friends to
play, instead of just entering the username. Along with that, we would like to
incorporate a messaging portion between friends, so that each user could chat with
their partner, as well as trash talk a little.
